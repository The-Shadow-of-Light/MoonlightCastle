You can read my novels in any order you wish. I suggest just looking through them and choosing the one you find most interesting.

            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>I have always enjoyed romance ever since I was a kid, but there were always things I disliked about it such as love triangles, harems, cheating etc. Later on I realized what soulmate romance was and I kinda fell in love with the concept. That is one of the main reasons why I started writing The Eternal Dance of Light and Darkness. </p>

            <button class="faq-question">6: Why did you write Moonlight Castle?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
I started writing bc I could never find a novel I truly enjoyed reading. Don't get me wrong, a lot of novels did come close to it, but even novels that came close to it had certain things that just weren't to my taste. As such I decided to just try and write my own novel. One I could truly enjoy reading.

              7: What Inspired you to write Moonlight Castle?
            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>The idea for Moonlight Castle came to me when I was trying to sleep but couldn't. So as per usual I just started fantasizing about stuff, about distant fantasy worlds. Then I thought to myself, if I could live any life I could think of, what kind of life would I want to live? I decided that living inside of Moonlight Castle would be my perfect life. </p>
              <p>As for inspiration, the Webnovels I read inspired me to write.</p>

            <button class="faq-question">9: Is Moonlight Castle free to read?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>yes.</p>
              <p>Moonlight Castle will forever be free to read. I heard that if you want to publish your writing physically you can't have it online for free, but I don't expect my writing to be popular enough to be published, and even if it did I will make sure you can read Moonlight Castle for free online.</p>
              <p>I grew up broke myself so I know how it feels like to want to read but can't afford to. As a little kid I always enjoyed reading, but at the library they only had old books for adults without any drawings etc. So I used to go to a bookstore and read the nice children's books there. It took quite some passive aggressiveness for my dumb child brain to finally figure out you weren't supposed to do that. I didn't really have access to the internet back then, so I couldn't read it online for free through other means. 
              <p>For legal reasons I can't tell you how to read books online for free. However if you type "FMHY" into google you might, theoretically, find a lot of nice things to read online. Idk tho, I am dumb asf. So don't hold me responsible for anything. Remember to use tor, a proxy or a vpn or whatever. And always be careful for malware. This is just advice from one broke boy to another. </p>
              <p>So yeah, I will do my best to make sure my writing will always be able to be read online for free. </p>
